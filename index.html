						<h2>What is Rules as Code?</h2>
						<p>In short - it's translating <em>prescriptive</em> rules into machine-readable computer code</p>
						<p><span style="position: left; font-size:0.4em">Perspective rules are those which can provide definitive answers to questions - for example, yes/no questions, calculations, logic, etc.</span></p>

						<h2>Why code rules?</h2>
						<p>Rules are often complicated, difficult to understand, and create barriers to accessing services or programs which the rules are designed for.</p>

						<h2>The promise of Rules as Code is...</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>Help people understand the rules</li>
							<li>Enable further digital solutions</li>
							<li>Make compliance easier</li>
							<li>For the ESS, create further energy savings</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Rules as Code is already happening</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Department of Customer Service - Community Gaming, Better Regulation Division and more...</li>
							<li>New Zealand - Social Security Entitlements</li>
							<li>France - social benefits, tax reforms</li>
							<li>Even eTax is a form of Rules as Code (through coded tax regulations in an app)</li>

						<h3>The value for the ESS is...</h3>
						<p><span>We can use Rules as Code to inform implementation of the Rule.</span></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What we've done so far is...</h3>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Worked with DCS to learn how to build a Rules as Code coding environment.</p>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Coded the NABERS method of the Rule (for Offices and Apartments).</p>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Built test cases for the use of this method.</p>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Reviewed the code with Legal.</p>						
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Started the process of building a proof of concept webform.</p>			
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Started planning the next sections of the ESS to code.</p>			
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>A simple example of the value of our current work.</h3>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">There's a term "Counted Energy Savings" in the NABERS method of the ESS.</p>
						<p span style="font-size:0.7em">It appears twice - and it's defined slightly differently both times it appears.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<p> The difference in meanings is summarised below.<p>
					<img width="80%" alt="Down arrow" data-lazy-loaded="" data-src="img/counted_energy_ savings_definitions.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
					<p>Strictly following the existing definitions of Counted Energy Savings within the Rule, it would be impossible to calculate ESCs within NABERS because of this ambiguity - the machine would be unsure of what definition to use.<p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
					<h3>Benefits beyond making the code publicly available:</h3>
					<p><span>Establish hierarchy, structure and connections between terms used throughout the Rule</span></p>
					<p><span><em>to ensure consistency</em> in the meaning of these terms</span></p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Benefits beyond making the code publicly available:</h3>
					<p><span>Testing the interpretation of the rules with non-subject matter experts</span></p>
					<p><span><em>to ensure clarity</em> of interpretation across the different stakeholder groups</span></p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Benefits beyond making the code publicly available:</h3>
					<p><span>Test coding the written rules into machine-readable language</span></p>
					<p><span><em>to remove ambiguity</em> for when users do the same</span></p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h2>We've found that coding the rules is the easy part.</h2>
					<p><span>But itâ€™s only part of developing Better Rules.</span></p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>Better Rules</h3>
					<p>The Better Rules framework provides a template for how we can do rule changes</p>
					<p><em>and</em></p>
					<p>Coding the rules will transform how the rules operate and are implemented.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h3>The current rule change process is very linear.</h3>
					<p>Here's a simplified version of the current process.</p>

					<h3>The end goal is to use an integrated Better Rules approach to build a better end product.</h3>

					<h3>The key is integrating the perspectives and knowledge of <strong><em>different</em></strong> experts to ensure the rules deliver the best outcome for the user, following rule implementation.</h3>

				<h3>What's next?<h3>
				<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Testing this prototype with NABERS stakeholders</p>
				<p span style="font-size:0.7em">Begin scaling this approach throughout the rest of the current ESS Rule</p>
